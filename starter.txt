Absolutely—let’s spin up a **clean React + Vite + TypeScript + Material UI** app and deploy it to **AWS Amplify (Gen 2)** without using any AWS starter template. I’ll break it into three parts:

1.  Create the React/Vite/TS project and add MUI
2.  Prepare the repo for Amplify Hosting (Gen 2)
3.  Connect & deploy in Amplify (no template)

I’ll include copy‑paste commands, the minimal `amplify.yml`, and a few production tips.

***

## 1) Create a brand‑new React + Vite + TypeScript app and add Material UI

```bash
# 1) Scaffold with Vite (React + TS)
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-app

# 2) Install deps and run locally
npm install
npm run dev
```

*   Vite’s official guide recommends `npm create vite@latest` and notes current Node requirements (Node 20.19+ or 22.12+)—upgrade if your PM warns you. [\[vite.dev\]](https://vite.dev/guide/)

Add **Material UI** (Emotion is the default styling engine):

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
# (optional) icons and Roboto font
npm install @mui/icons-material @fontsource/roboto
```

In your entry (e.g., `src/main.tsx`), you can import the Roboto fonts:

```ts
import '@fontsource/roboto/300.css';
import '@fontsource/roboto/400.css';
import '@fontsource/roboto/500.css';
import '@fontsource/roboto/700.css';
```

And test MUI with a quick component (e.g., in `App.tsx`):

```tsx
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

export default function App() {
  return <Button variant="contained">Hello world</Button>;
}
```

*   Install steps and peer‑dep notes come from MUI’s Installation guide. [\[mui.com\]](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)

> **Tip:** Vite’s default production output directory is `dist`, which is exactly what we’ll point Amplify to—in other words, no special Vite config is required just to deploy. [\[vite.dev\]](https://vite.dev/guide/)

***

## 2) Add a minimal build spec (`amplify.yml`) to the repo (optional but recommended)

Amplify can auto‑detect build commands for many front‑end frameworks, but placing an explicit `amplify.yml` at the **repo root** avoids surprises, especially with CI or monorepos. Here’s a minimal one for **React + Vite**:

```yaml
# amplify.yml
version: 1
applications:
  - frontend:
      phases:
        preBuild:
          commands:
            - npm ci
        build:
          commands:
            - npm run build
        postBuild:
          commands:
            - echo "Build finished"
      artifacts:
        baseDirectory: dist
        files:
          - '**/*'
      cache:
        paths:
          - node_modules/**/*
```

*   `amplify.yml` keys (`version`, `applications`, `frontend.phases`, `artifacts.baseDirectory`, `cache.paths`) come from the **Amplify Hosting build specification reference** and “build settings” docs; the `dist` output aligns with Vite defaults. [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/yml-specification-syntax.html), [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/build-settings.html)
*   A working minimal React/Vite example matches community patterns collected in “Amplify.yml cookbook (2025)”. [\[awswithatiq.com\]](https://awswithatiq.com/amplify-yml-examples-the-complete-cookbook-2025-edition/)

> **When is `amplify.yml` required?**  
> If you rely on Amplify’s console‑saved build settings, you can skip the file. But if the file is present in your repo root, its settings **override** the console’s saved settings, which is often preferred for repeatable CI. [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/build-settings.html)

***

## 3) Connect the repo in **Amplify Gen 2** and deploy (no template)

You can deploy a “plain” front‑end repo—no Amplify starter necessary.

### A. Push code to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket/CodeCommit)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: init vite+react+ts+mui"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/<repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

### B. In the AWS Console → **Amplify** → **Host web app**

1.  Choose your Git provider (e.g., **GitHub**).
2.  Authorize the **Amplify GitHub App** and select the repo + branch (read‑only, fine‑grained access). [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/setting-up-GitHub-access.html)
3.  On **Build settings**, Amplify should auto‑detect `npm ci` → `npm run build` and **`dist`** as the output; if you keep your `amplify.yml`, just accept defaults and continue. [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/build-settings.html)
4.  Click **Save and deploy**. Your app is built and served on Amplify’s global CDN; you’ll get a URL when the job finishes. [\[dev.to\]](https://dev.to/aws-heroes/trying-various-settings-for-aws-amplify-gen2-hosting-3p84)

That’s it—no AWS template involved. You started from Vite’s React TS skeleton, added MUI, and deployed straight to Amplify Hosting.

***

## Optional: adding an Amplify **Gen 2 backend** later (still no starter)

If later you want Cognito/Auth, Data (AppSync/DynamoDB), Functions, etc., you can **layer Amplify Gen 2** onto your existing app without switching to a template:

*   **Option 1 (recommended):** `npm create amplify@latest` inside your existing project: this scaffolds a lightweight `amplify/` folder with type‑safe backend definitions (TypeScript). Then `npx ampx sandbox` to run a local cloud sandbox. [\[docs.amplify.aws\]](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/manual-installation/)
*   **Option 2 (fully manual):** add `@aws-amplify/backend` & `@aws-amplify/backend-cli`, create `amplify/backend.ts`, and define resources with `define*` helpers. Ensure ESM config if needed. [\[docs.amplify.aws\]](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/manual-installation/)

If you go fullstack later and need secrets (e.g., OAuth provider keys), **use Amplify’s Secrets** rather than plain environment variables; secrets are managed via Parameter Store and retrieved safely at build/runtime in Gen 2. [\[docs.amplify.aws\]](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/deploy-and-host/fullstack-branching/secrets-and-vars/)

***

## Common gotchas & production tips

*   **Node versions:** Vite templates expect modern Node (≥20.19+). Set the Node runtime in Amplify (build image) if you see engine warnings. [\[vite.dev\]](https://vite.dev/guide/)
*   **Output folder:** Make sure `artifacts.baseDirectory` is **`dist`** (Vite’s default). If you accidentally point Amplify elsewhere, you’ll deploy a blank site. [\[awswithatiq.com\]](https://awswithatiq.com/amplify-yml-examples-the-complete-cookbook-2025-edition/)
*   **Build settings precedence:** If `amplify.yml` is in your repo, it overrides console‑saved build settings. Keep one source of truth. [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/build-settings.html)
*   **Monorepo later?** Use the **monorepo** build spec with `applications[]` and `appRoot`, and set `AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT` to match. [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/monorepo-configuration.html)
*   **Environment variables vs. secrets:** Prefer **Secrets** for sensitive values; plain env vars are baked into build artifacts. [\[docs.amplify.aws\]](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/deploy-and-host/fullstack-branching/secrets-and-vars/), [\[docs.amplify.aws\]](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/functions/environment-variables-and-secrets/)

## Quick checklist (copy/paste)

1.  `npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts` [\[vite.dev\]](https://vite.dev/guide/)
2.  `npm i` → `npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled` (plus optional icons/font) [\[mui.com\]](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
3.  (Optional) add `amplify.yml` with `baseDirectory: dist` [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/yml-specification-syntax.html), [\[awswithatiq.com\]](https://awswithatiq.com/amplify-yml-examples-the-complete-cookbook-2025-edition/)
4.  Push to GitHub
5.  Amplify Console → **Host web app** → connect GitHub repo/branch → review build settings → **Save and deploy** [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/setting-up-GitHub-access.html), [\[docs.aws.amazon.com\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/build-settings.html), [\[dev.to\]](https://dev.to/aws-heroes/trying-various-settings-for-aws-amplify-gen2-hosting-3p84)

***

If you want, I can:

*   Generate the project locally for you (I’ll give you a ready‑to‑use repo tree and `amplify.yml`),
*   Add a basic **MUI theme** scaffold (palette, typography),
*   Or set up a **full CI checklist** for Amplify (cache paths, preview builds, env/secret patterns).

How far do you want me to take it—just the front end, or should we also wire a minimal Gen 2 backend (auth + a small data model) so you can test end‑to‑end?
